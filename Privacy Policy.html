				<p><strong>Last updated May 25, 2025</strong></p>

				<p>This Privacy Policy explains how I (the sole developer of the StreakUp app, doing business as
					StreakUp OR MKAAPPS) might access, collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your personal
					information when you use StreakUp, including when you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Download and use my mobile application (StreakUp), or any other application of mine that links
						to this Privacy Notice</li>
					<li>Use StreakUp. StreakUp is an app where users can save and track their own progress with the help
						of "Streaks". "Streaks" are activities that the user can fully customize using a name, an icon
						from the available selection and description. "Streaks" allow the user to track their progress
						by assigning which day they have completed and assigning a note for the day, so the user can
						describe their activity on the given day (OPTIONAL)</li>
					<li>Engage with me in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Reading this Privacy Notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. I am
					responsible for making decisions about how your personal information is processed. If you do not
					agree with my policies and practices, please do not use my Services. If you still have any questions
					or concerns, please contact me at <span
						class="text-color-orange"><strong>streakup.app.official@gmail.com</strong></span>.</p>

				<h2>2. HOW DO I PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I process your information to provide, improve, and
						administer my Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply
						with law.</em></p>

				<p><strong>I process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact
						with my Services, including:</strong></p>

							accounts.</strong> I may process your information so you can create and log in to your

				<h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I only process your personal information when I believe it is
						necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable
						law.</em></p>

				<h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</h3>

				<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to explain the valid legal bases
					I rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, I may rely on the following legal
					bases to process your personal information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Consent.</strong> I may process your information if you have given me permission (i.e.,
						consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent
						at any time.</li>
					<li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> I may process your personal information when I
						believe it is necessary to fulfill my contractual obligations to you, including providing my
						Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>

						necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement
						body or regulatory agency.</li>
					<li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> I may process your information where I believe it is necessary
						to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations
						involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</h3>

				<p>I may process your information if you have given me specific permission (i.e., express consent) to
					use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
					inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

				<h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I may share information in specific situations.</em></p>

				<p>We share the minimum data required with a few service providers that help run the app — primarily
					Google's Firebase (for accounts, storage, analytics, and crash reports) and Google AdMob (to show
					ads). Payment processing for Play purchases is handled by Google Payments. You can control ad
					personalization in your Google ad settings or by resetting your device's Advertising ID.</p>

				<h2>5. WHAT IS MY STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I am not responsible for the safety of any information that
						you share with third parties that I may link to or who advertise on my Services, but are not
						affiliated with, my Services.</em></p>

				<p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain
					advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with me and which may link to other
					websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, I do not make any guarantee regarding any such
					third parties, and I will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party
					websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service,
					or application does not imply an endorsement by me. I cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of
					data you provide to any third-party websites. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by
					this Privacy Notice.</p>

				<h2>6. DO I USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect
						and store your information.</em></p>

				<p>I permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on my Services for
					analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor
					advertisements to your interests. The third parties and service providers use their technology to
					provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either
					on my Services or on other websites.</p>

				<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

				<p>I may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of the Services. For
					more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a
						href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy & Terms page</a>.</p>

				<h2>7. HOW DO I HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>If you choose to register or log in to my Services using a
						social media account, I may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>

				<p>My Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account
					details (like your Google logins). Where you choose to do this, I will receive certain profile
					information about you from your social media provider. The profile information I receive may vary
					depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address,
					and profile picture.</p>

				<p>I will use the information I receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice
					or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that I do not control,
					and am not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
					provider.</p>

				<h2>8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I may transfer, store, and process your information in
						countries other than your own.</em></p>

				<p>My servers are located in Finland (Firebase's Servers). If you are accessing our Services from
					outside Finland, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by, and
					processed by the facilities of the third parties with whom I may share your personal information, in
					and other countries.</p>

				<h2>9. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
						the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

				<p>I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
					this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. No purpose in
					this notice will require me keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in
					which users have an account with us.</p>

				<p>When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will delete
					such information, or, if this is not possible, then I will securely store your personal information
					and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

				<h2>10. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

				<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>I aim to protect your personal information through a system
						of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

				<p>Despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
					Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise
					or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
					defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I
					will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
					from my Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
					environment.</p>

				<h2>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

				<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable
					data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
					personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
					your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to
					automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
					processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting me using the
					contact details provided below.</p>

				<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If I am relying on your consent to process your personal
					information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have
					the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me at the details provided below.</p>

				<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
					nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
					conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

				<h3>Account Information</h3>

				<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
					account, you can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contact me using the contact information provided.</li>
					<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, I will deactivate or delete your account and information
					from my active databases. However, I may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
					troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce my legal terms and/or comply with
					applicable legal requirements.</p>

					have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

				<h3>Request Verification</h3>

				<p>Upon receiving your request, I will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
					about whom I have the information in my system. I will only use personal information provided in
					your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if I cannot verify
